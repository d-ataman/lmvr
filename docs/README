Generating Documentation
------------------------

The user instructions for Morfessor FlatCat 1.0 are available as Sphinx source
files (see http://sphinx-doc.org/). To build the documentation you need
both the 'sphinx' and the 'sphinxcontrib-napoleon' package. With a recent
version of pip you could do::

    pip install -e .[docs]

to automatically install the required dependencies for making the docs.

After installing Sphinx, you can generate the documentation in different
formats using the Makefile or make.bat in the directory "docs". For
example, to generate a PDF file, type "make latexpdf", and to generate
a single HTML file, type "make singlehtml". Type "make help" to see
all available formats.

The documentation can also be read online on FIXME
