General
=======

Morfessor FlatCat is a method for learning of morphological segmentation of natural language.
FlatCat uses a Hidden Markov Model with the states (morph categories) ``{prefix, stem, suffix, non-morpheme}``
for modeling the word internal ordering of morphs.
The non-morpheme category (marked ZZZ) is intended to catch segments
that are not proper morphs because they are fragments of a larger morph.
FlatCat can be trained in an unsupervised or semi-supervised fashion.

Publications
------------

The Morfessor FlatCat method is presented in the paper [Gronroos2014a]_.
The paper is available for download from
http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C/C14/C14-1111.pdf

The Morfessor FlatCat method is described in detail in the Master's Thesis [Gronroos2014b]_.

Morfessor FlatCat was developed together with the Morfessor 2.0 software package.
The work done in Morfessor 2.0 is described in detail in the Morfessor 2.0
Technical Report [TechRep]_. The report is available for download from

Citing
------

The authors do kindly ask that you cite the Morfessor FlatCat paper
 [Gronroos2014a]_ when using this tool in academic publications.

In addition, when you refer to other Morfessor algorithms, you should cite the
respective publications where they have been introduced. For example, the first
Morfessor algorithm was published in [Creutz2002]_ and the semi-supervised
extension in [Kohonen2010]_. See [TechRep]_ for further information on the
relevant publications.
